# Vision for polish-text

## Purpose
Polish-text is a specialized AI-powered tool focused on elevating written communication to its highest potential - making rough drafts shine, unclear messages crystal clear, and good writing great.

## Core Philosophy
Everyone has important things to say, but not everyone has the time or skills to craft perfect prose. Polish-text bridges that gap, acting as an intelligent writing assistant that preserves your voice while enhancing your message.

## Problem We Solve
- Professional emails that don't quite hit the right tone
- Technical documentation that's accurate but hard to follow
- Blog posts and articles that need that final polish
- Non-native speakers wanting to perfect their English writing
- Time pressure preventing careful editing and revision
- Inconsistent writing quality across teams

## Design Principles

### 1. Preserve Voice, Enhance Clarity
We don't rewrite - we refine. The author's voice and intent remain intact while grammar, structure, and flow improve.

### 2. Context-Aware Enhancement
Different contexts require different styles:
- Professional emails need formality
- Technical docs need precision
- Marketing copy needs impact
- Academic writing needs rigor

### 3. Intelligent Processing
- Automatic summarization for context when processing long documents
- Smart chunking to maintain coherence
- Preservation of technical terms and proper nouns
- Understanding of domain-specific language

### 4. Seamless Integration
- Works with any text source
- Fits into existing workflows
- Command-line first for automation
- Provider-agnostic for flexibility

## Future Direction

### Near Term
- Style profiles (formal, casual, technical, creative)
- Industry-specific enhancements (legal, medical, academic)
- Tone adjustment (friendly, authoritative, empathetic)
- Multi-language support beyond English
- Track changes mode to show edits

### Long Term
- Learning from user preferences
- Team style guides and consistency checking
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Integration with popular writing tools
- Grammar explanation and writing education

## Success Metrics
- Text clarity improves measurably (readability scores)
- Users save time on editing and revision
- Consistent quality across all written communication
- Non-native speakers achieve native-level fluency
- Zero meaning lost in the polishing process

## Non-Goals
- Not a content generator - we enhance, not create
- Not a plagiarism tool - we preserve originality
- Not a translation service - we polish within a language
- Not enforcing a single "correct" style
- Not replacing human creativity and nuance

## Relationship to summarize-text
While summarize-text condenses and extracts insights, polish-text perfects and refines. They're complementary tools:
- summarize-text: "What does this say?" → Shorter, clearer
- polish-text: "How can I say this better?" → Same length, better quality

Together, they form a complete text processing toolkit for the modern command line.
